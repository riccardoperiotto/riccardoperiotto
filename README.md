### Hi there üëã
#### I am Riccardo Periotto, welcome to my GitHub!

## üß¨ Bio
Driven by my passion for learning and technology, I embraced the ICT world in high
school and delved into the subject until I got my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science.
After that, I worked in the field for one year and finally graduated in Autonomous Systems from a double degree program two years later.
Since then, I have been working as a Software Engineer for robotics in Munich, where I contribute to simplifying the application of AI-driven solutions to industrial automation, particularly robotics.

## üéì Background
- BSc in **Computer Science**, University of Trento (UniTN)
- MSc in **Autonomous System**, EIT Digital at University of Trento (UniTN) and Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan (KTH)
