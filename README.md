### Hi there üëã
#### I am Riccardo Periotto, welcome to my GitHub!

## üß¨ Bio
Driven by my passion for learning and technology, I approached the ICT world during high school and delved into the subject until I graduated in Computer Science. Between my bachelor's and master's degrees, I worked in the field for a year to better understand which specialization was the most suitable for me.

I have now completed my master's degree in Autonomous Systems, and I know that my primary goal is to develop software solutions for robots, as this will allow me to use the wide range of knowledge I've acquired throughout my education.
       
Robotics, control, and deep learning are the subjects I prefer, and I am eager to apply them to my next challenge!

## üéì My background
- BSc in **Computer Science**, University of Trento (UniTN)
- MSc in **Autonomous System**, EIT Digital at University of Trento (UniTN) and Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan (KTH)
